      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a creative professional with over five years of experience in visual storytelling 
        through videography, photography, and graphic design. I’m passionate about crafting 
        content that’s not only eye-catching but also meaningful and accessible to diverse 
        audiences. I’ve worked with brands and organizations to bring their stories to life 
        across digital platforms. Beyond my creative work, I love giving back by hosting 
        community workshops where I help young people explore their own artistic talents.
